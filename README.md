# FreeStep

Open source, private chat goodness. Built on node.js/socket.io/Bootstrap.

## Libraries used
<ul>
  <li>node.js / npm</li>
  <li>socket.io</li>
  <li>express</li>
</ul>

Super easy to develop on your own. Will expand this later; pardon the domain name used in dev - it was all I had unused.i

Special thanks to https://github.com/tamaspiros/advanced-chat, whose project was my main teacher of node and socket.
